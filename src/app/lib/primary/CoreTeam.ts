    quotes:
      "Surfing development has been a significant part of my professional life. I was a professional surfer throughout my life, traveling around the globe and competing since a young age. In 2001, I contributed to the development of surfing by creating the Indonesian Surfing Championship. This initiative evolved into the Asian Surfing Championship in 2008, with our company accelerating the development of surfing in Indonesia and beyond through the ASC since 2004. Additionally, I have been involved in youth movement by creating the Grom Patrol surf series since 2019. I also played a role in helping Indonesia secure gold medals in the Sea Games in Manila and assisted the first Indonesian surfer to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.With all this experience, ASPA will be the channel to help every potential athlete achieve their goals by providing guidance and strategy.",
